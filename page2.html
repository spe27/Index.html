        <p>Apparently only Americans can do it and Finland? I have never witnessed as big hyper-markets as which we have in Finland or what they have in the U.S. The other reality is as well that our selection just smashes already in the milk and candy section to any oth-er country I have been. The amount of domestic products is also delightfully large. Ag-riculture is big in Holland but you know what, they export all the <b>good</b> goodies to elsewhere! I can’t even describe how good so basic vegetable as cucumber tasted when I got back here. Don’t believe me? Try it yourself, and then we can talk. </p>
